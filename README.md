# EECS_504_Project
Final Project for EECS 504 Fundations of Computer Vision
<br />Project: Automatic Phase Characterization of Additively Manufactured Materials
<br />Team: Pixel Pioneers
<br />Members: Soumyadeep Dasgupta, Nicholas David, Jingxian Li, Yujie Liu

We develop two learning based computer vision systems, based of the Unet++ and Segment Anything models, to automatically identify and label the phase fractions of common constituents inside steels using semantic segmentation approaches.![](models/output/UnetPlusPlus/test_images/test4_8.png)
